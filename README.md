**Academic Project**: Part of a Master's Thesis at Cracow University of Technology focusing on usage of AI in the transportation systems in peak, rush hours.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Engine**: Godot 4.4
- **Language**: C# (.NET 8.0) with GDScript for UI components
- **Architecture**: Dependency injection with custom DI container
- **Pathfinding**: Custom A\* implementation with graph-based routing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Godot 4.4](https://godotengine.org/download/) or later
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone github.com/domiotek/peak-transit
   cd peak-transit
   ```

2. Open the project in Godot:

   - Launch Godot Engine

   - Wait for the project to import and compile

3. Run the project from Godot or press F5

## üéÆ Controls

- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Move camera viewport
- **F12**: Access debug interface and development tools
- **Speed Controls**:
  - `space`: pause/resume simulation
  - `1-4`: control simulation speed

## üîß Architecture

### Dependency Injection

The project uses a custom dependency injection container that bridges C# and GDScript:

- `DIContainer.cs`: Main DI container for C# services
- `GDInjector.gd`: GDScript interface for dependency injection
- `CSInjector.cs`: C# service locator

### Network System

- **NetGraph**: Graph representation of the transit network
- **NetNode**: Intersection points and stops
- **NetSegment**: Road/track segments connecting nodes
- **NetLane**: Individual lanes within segments

### Pathfinding

- Multi-threaded pathfinding using A\* algorithm
- Concurrent request queue for handling multiple path calculations
- Optimized for real-time simulation performance

## üêõ Debugging

The game includes comprehensive debugging tools:

- Visual overlay for camera bounds and network elements
- Debug toggles for various system components
- Intersection analysis and visualization
- Auto-breakpoints accessible via UI for various elements on next `process` call

Access debug tools by pressing the `F12` key during gameplay.
